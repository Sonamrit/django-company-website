# Django Company Website  
This is the first website I developed while learning Django. I used a **pre-built Bootstrap template** to design the frontend and integrated it with Django for dynamic content. The website includes essential features such as:  

- **Home, About, and Services pages**  
- **Dynamic content rendering using Django templates**  
- **Contact form with database integration**  
- **Responsive UI with a Bootstrap template**  
- **Basic CRUD operations for managing content**  

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of Django, including integrating templates, working with models and views, and connecting a database with a Bootstrap-based UI.
